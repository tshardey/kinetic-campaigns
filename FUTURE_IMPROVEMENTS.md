# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future features, expansions, and mechanics for the Kinetic Campaigns platform to enhance player progression and real-world integration.

## New Map Locations & Real-World Integration

- **Dojo / Training Center**
  - **Concept:** Similar to the Nexus tent, players can unlock a dedicated training center on the map.
  - **Mechanic:** Players can level up at this location by completing and logging in-person fitness classes (e.g., martial arts, yoga, group fitness).

- **Arena / Battledome**
  - **Concept:** An unlockable, high-stakes location on the map.
  - **Mechanic:** Provides a venue for players to level up by completing significant real-world physical challenges and events, such as running a 5K, completing a Spartan Race, or participating in a powerlifting meet.

## Game Mechanics & Economy

- **Dynamic Leveling & Scaling**
  - **Player Progression:** When a player levels up, their maximum health capacity increases.
  - **Enemy Scaling:** To maintain a challenging experience, monster difficulty scales alongside the player. The number of strikes (workouts) needed to defeat monsters will increase non-linearly as the player's level rises.

- **In-Game Economy (Item Shop)**
  - Introduce an item shop where players can spend their earned in-game credits.
  - Items could include temporary buffs, cosmetic upgrades for their avatar/base, or consumable healing items to aid in tough battles.

## Content Expansion

- **Next Campaign**
  - **Sequel Campaign:** Continue the story in the current setting, introducing new zones, tougher enemies, and continuing the narrative arc.
  - **New Setting:** Transport players to a completely new world or theme (e.g., sci-fi, cyberpunk, historical fantasy) with a fresh map, new monster types, and distinct challenges.
