# **Realm Package: The Verdant Expanse of Omija**

## **Realm Theme & Overview**

Welcome, Worldhopper, to the Verdant Expanse of Omija. You have materialized in a realm where the breeze carries the scent of sea salt and sweet brewing herbs, and the tall grass hides spirits as ancient as the soil itself. Omija is a whimsical, sun-drenched archipelago where the physical and spiritual worlds hold hands. Here, memories are tangible—they leave physical imprints on the environment, and the locals revere the quiet power of nature, utilizing complex alchemy and martial artistry to maintain balance.

However, your arrival coincides with a great ecological and spiritual disruption. A foul, oily anomaly known as the "Inkrot" has begun washing ashore, mutating the vibrant wildlife and corrupting the peaceful kami that reside in the coastal highlands and deep wetlands. To survive and conquer this Realm, you must channel the discipline of the local martial masters, harvest rare energetic flora, and use your physical exertions to cleanse the island of the Abyssal Tide before the corruption swallows the memories of Omija forever.

Worldhoppers must strap heavy, continuously burning "Spirit Flames" to their backs and race up the winding, perilous, ten-thousand-step staircase of the Coastal Highlands. You must outrun a tidal wave of encroaching shadow from the Shallows, pushing your physical endurance to its absolute limit to place your lantern at the summit before the sun rises.
